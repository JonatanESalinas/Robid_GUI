# Robid_GUI
Repository that contains code of a GUI for the robot "Robid", a medical assistant robot.

The Robid robot project aims to build a robot capable of measure the temperature and oximetry of patients, in a hospital environment.

The aim with the creation of a GUI for the robot in this project, is give the hospital staff the opportunity to monitor the current robot position; see statistics of each robot walk; receive, store and show the clinical data of each patient collected by the robot (temperature and oxygen); and have the opportunity to control the robot in case of failure in the navigation system as well. From the patients side, the GUI would allow the robot to 'greet the patients' and give them specific instructions previously written by the nurse or doctor.

The GUI is being developed using Qt designer with PyQt5. The interface could be runned with: python interfaceBot.py
